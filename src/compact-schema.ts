/**
 * Compact JSON-Schema projection — the middle detail tier between shipping a
 * tool's FULL definition and not advertising it at all.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Tool delivery used to be binary: a tool was either advertised
 * with its complete schema and guidance prose, or it was invisible. That forced
 * choice is what made a seed list a zero-sum fight — admitting one heavy tool
 * meant dropping another — and it is why high-demand heavyweights get cut.
 * A COMPACT tier removes the false choice: a compact definition still lets a
 * model form a VALID call, at a fraction of the bytes.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT, and it is the whole point: compact is NEVER A PARTIAL CONTRACT.
 * Everything a caller needs to construct an accepted argument object survives —
 * property names, types, the required set, enum members, numeric and length
 * bounds, oneOf/anyOf/allOf discriminators, nested object/array shape, and
 * $defs/$ref structure. What is dropped is PROSE ONLY: `description`, `title`,
 * `examples`/`example`, and `default`.
 *
 * ⚠ `$defs`/`$ref` STRUCTURE IS PRESERVED, NOT INLINED. `$defs` is precisely
 * what keeps a duplicated sub-schema from being paid for once per use site, so
 * inlining it would inflate exactly the budget this projection exists to cut.
 * (`schema-ref-inline.ts` in the host inlines in the OPPOSITE direction, for
 * human-facing discovery renderers where a reader cannot follow a $ref — that
 * is a different job with a different cost model. Do not reuse it here.)
 *
 * ⚠ `default` IS DROPPED AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE, NARROW BET. A default is
 * advisory to the CALLER but authoritative in the SERVER, which applies it
 * whether or not the caller ever saw it — so removing it cannot change what an
 * omitted field resolves to. It can only change what a model GUESSES an omitted
 * field will do. Anything load-bearing enough that a caller must see it belongs
 * in the required set or an enum, both of which survive.
 *
 * Domain-free by construction, and therefore here rather than in the host:
 * nothing below knows what a Papercusp tool, workspace or role is.
