/**
 * Payload tiers — a per-session / per-call axis over WHAT a tool returns
 * (field selection, row caps), distinct from the result-FORMAT axis
 * (serialize-result.ts, which encodes whatever data it is given).
 *
 * Contract (context-trimming-tiers-2026-07-01 D-004, owner-ratified):
 *   - `full` IS the tool's unshaped response while it fits the transport.
 *     Normal-size unshaped tools remain byte-identical (zero migration);
 *     oversized default-tier responses get a loud generic projection.
 *   - Tools opt in incrementally by declaring `shape.standard` /
 *     `shape.trimmed` on their definition; resolution falls back
 *     trimmed → standard → full.
 *   - The session's tier rides the host context (`ctx.contextTier`, wired by
 *     the host from its transport — e.g. an MCP URL param); any single call
 *     may override with a `payloadTier` arg (stripped before schema
 *     validation), so a trimmed session can always fetch one full payload.
 *   - Shaping NEVER breaks a call: a throwing shaper logs and serves the
 *     unshaped data.
 *   - No silent caps at the meta level: when a non-full session would receive
 *     a LARGE unshaped payload, the framework returns a bounded projection
 *     with omission evidence + a full-detail re-fetch instruction. A
 *     once-per-tool ratchet warning still names the missing custom shaper.
 *   - HARD CEILING (WI-2859): even `full` must fit the transport result cap —
 *     an over-cap result is rejected/file-dumped by the client, which is worse
 *     than a graceful downgrade. So a result over PAYLOAD_TIER_HARD_CEILING_CHARS
 *     force-applies the smallest declared shaper regardless of the resolved tier.

 * runs). The omitted values are in it, so point there — which is also what

 *
 * `RE_CALL` — no durable artifact. The exit is a re-call carrying an explicit
 * `payloadTier:'full'`, which sets `explicitFullRequest` and skips the

 * `buildDefaultRecoveryNext` — twenty lines away, building the `next` field of
 * this same projection — spelled out that `payloadTier` is framework-reserved,
 * stripped before schema validation, absent from the tool's published schema,
 * and therefore REJECTED by a schema-validating client on a direct call.
 *
 * Two emitters in one module, disagreeing about one route. The uncaveated one
 * is the string an agent actually reads (it travels INSIDE the truncated
 * payload, fired up to 5x per result) while the honest one is a sibling field
 * that is routinely not read — so the divergence resolved, every time, toward
 * the over-claim. WI-1697551.
 *
 * So it defers instead of asserting: it names the field that carries the whole
 * conditional story, exactly as `CURSOR` names the artifact that holds the
 * bytes. Both pointers now say "the truth is HERE" rather than "this call will
 * work". It is also 11 chars shorter than the claim it replaces, and this
 * string shares the projection's char budget with the retained preview
 * (EI-20685195115158619), so the honest form is the cheap one too.

 *
 * The comparison that motivated it: OMP replaces evicted content with
 * `[shaken ~N tokens — recover: artifact://<id> (region N)]`; opencode uses a
 * fixed `[Old tool result content cleared]`. The first tells the model how much
 * went and how to get it back, so it can decide whether recovery is worth a
 * call; the second tells it neither, so the only rational move is to re-run the
 * whole tool or silently proceed on partial data. Our bare
 * `[omitted: projection budget]` was the second kind.
 *
 * ⚠ The research is equally explicit that a self-describing placeholder is WORSE
 * than nothing if the recovery pointer it advertises does not resolve — it
 * becomes a lie the model trusts. So WHICH pointer is correct depends on the
 * caller, and this marker must not hard-code one.
 *
 * EI-19371883353428338 measured what hard-coding cost. This marker named

 * (the door's own `rawDispatchTemplate`) — returned a BYTE-IDENTICAL truncated
 * body, while the spill this comment used to dismiss held the complete field
 * (3042 of 3042 chars, no truncation marker). Both halves of the old rationale
 * were inverted, and the marker fired 5x per result saying so confidently.
 *
 * The cause is that two layers cut, and `explicitFullRequest` exempts only one:
 * `applyPayloadTier`'s hard-ceiling force-shape. The result door
 * (`result-door.ts`) is a separate cut with no such exemption — but it spills
 * `result.content` BEFORE projecting, so its omitted values ARE recoverable,
 * just by the cursor rather than by a re-call. It signals this by passing
 * `opts.recovery`; that presence is the discriminant used below.
 *
 * Size is included only where the caller ALREADY computed it. The depth-boundary
