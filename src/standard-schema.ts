/**
 * Standard Schema adoption (plan P-020 / D-002).
 *
 * The engine validates a tool's `args`/`input`/`state` and card payloads against
 * any [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) validator — Zod 3.24+,
 * Valibot, ArkType, … — not Zod specifically. It reads only the `~standard`
 * property every such validator exposes; it never calls Zod-specific methods
 * like `.safeParse`. The Papercusp host keeps Zod for its ~96 tools (D-002 only
 * generalizes the core, not the consumers), and Zod schemas satisfy
 * `StandardSchemaV1` so they flow through unchanged.
 *
 * JSON-Schema generation is a *separate* pluggable concern (Standard Schema has
 * no JSON-Schema export) — see `schema-adapter.ts` (P-021).

 * EI-19968462161677390: an `invalid_union` issue's own top-level message is Zod's
 * generic "Invalid input" — it never names which field was wrong, because the union
 * itself has no field. The USEFUL diagnosis lives in `issue.errors`: one sub-issue
 * array per union branch, each carrying the field-level issues THAT branch produced
 * trying to match the input. A caller who sends a well-shaped ARRAY into
 * `z.union([z.string(), z.array(section)])` gets a deep, specific issue from the
 * array branch (e.g. `body[1].forYouBecause.note: Required`) and a shallow
 * "expected string, received array" from the string branch — the deep one is the
 * branch the caller actually meant, so its issues are the ones worth surfacing.
 *
 * Picks the branch reaching the greatest PATH DEPTH first; on a DEPTH TIE, the
 * branch with the FEWEST issues (ties within that keep the first). A branch
 * with depth 0 (e.g. the string branch's bare type mismatch) never wins once
 * any other branch located a specific field — reproduced live: reporting the
 * deepest branch turns "body: Invalid input" into
 * "body[1].forYouBecause.note: forYouBecause.relation:'other' REQUIRES a `note`".
 *
 * EI-22057520151022793: depth alone is blind to a union of SIBLING object
 * branches that all fail at the SAME shallow depth — facts:assert's 6-way
 * modality union is exactly this shape. For a private, undecidable fact
 * missing `settledBy`, every branch fails at path-depth 1 (a bare top-level
 * field mismatch), so the old code kept whichever branch was listed FIRST
 * regardless of how well it actually matched: the caller was told
 * "shareable: expected true" — a field that has nothing to do with their one
 * real mistake — because the shareable-federation branch happens to be
 * declared before the private-fact branch it actually meant. Fewer issues on
 * a tied-depth branch means fewer respects in which that branch disagrees
 * with the input, i.e. a closer match; break further ties by declaration
 * order, as before, so this only ever sharpens an existing ambiguous case.
 *
 * EI-22050255299103531 / EI-22063684320590166: an `unrecognized_keys` issue
 * DOES locate a specific field — it just records the name in `keys` rather
 * than in `path`, so measuring depth by `path.length` alone scored it 0 and
 * the rule above ("a depth-0 branch never wins once another located a field")
 * discarded it by construction. That inverts the ranking in the one case
 * where the validator has already identified the caller's exact mistake: for
 * facts:assert's 6-way union, a private fact carrying one stray legacy key
 * (`ttlDays`, `source_ref`) produces a branch whose ONLY complaint is that
 * key — the closest possible match — while every sibling branch reports its
 * own missing required fields at path-depth 1 and wins. Both reports show the
 * result: "harness: expected string; shareable: expected true; Unrecognized
 * key: <theirs>", which teaches the caller to add federation fields they
 * never wanted and buries the one actionable word at the end.
 *
 * So count an unrecognized key at the depth of the key it names (its path,
 * plus the one level the key itself sits at). A branch that matched
 * everything except a stray key then ranks as the specific match it is, and
 * the fewest-issues tie-break above selects it over branches that disagree in
 * more respects. This only re-ranks branches that already carry a named key;
 * a union with no unrecognized keys is scored exactly as before.
