/**
 * code-execution-tool-orchestration B-CX-1A — the DISPATCH BINDING.
 *
 * Binds the facade's injected `FacadeDispatch` to a real `UnifiedToolContext` + `DispatchProjectedDeps`,
 * so every tool call the model's script makes routes through the SAME dispatcher pipeline
 * (role/capability/envelope gates, quota, authorize, telemetry, audit) as an MCP `tools/call` —
 * code-mode is just another caller of the dispatcher, not a parallel tool path.
 *
 * On success it UNWRAPS the MCP `ToolResult` into the plain data the script should see (so model
 * code gets `result.items`, not `result.content[0].text`). On a dispatch failure it throws, so
 * the script's own try/catch — or the executor's error capture — surfaces it.

 * DEFINITIVELY did not happen: nothing was written, so a retry is safe.
 *
 * This distinction is load-bearing (EI-10951). The orchestrator used to count every
 * DISPATCHED write-effect call as "executed", including one the dispatcher rejected on
 * its args — so a script whose last call had a typo'd argument came back with
 * "1 write-effect call(s) already executed before this failure — do NOT blindly re-run
 * … to avoid a double-write." Nothing had executed. The warning sent the agent off to
 * verify a write that never happened, and taught it to distrust a warning that is
 * RIGHT in the case it exists for (a real partial batch). A safety warning that cries
 * wolf on the most common failure (a bad arg) is worse than no warning.
 *
 * Conservative by construction: a code NOT in this set is treated as UNKNOWN (it may
 * have landed), so a genuinely ambiguous failure still gets the loud warning. Only
 * codes that provably precede the handler belong here.
