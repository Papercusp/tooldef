/**
 * Partial-guidance projection — the middle detail tier for a tool's PROSE,
 * mirroring what `compact-schema.ts` does for its SCHEMA.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The COMPACT delivery tier drops `description` entirely
 * (`compactWireBytes` measures `description: ''`, and the transport seam's
 * `applyCompactTier` matches it exactly). That is a real cost, not a rounding
 * error: on the MCP `tools/list` wire `description` is the ONLY prose field a
 * tool carries, so a compact tool reaches the model as a bare name plus a
 * schema. Nothing tells it what the tool is FOR. A tool advertised with no
 * prose is barely better than a deferred one — and it is worse in one specific
 * way, because it occupies a seat while still being unidentifiable.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT. Partial keeps the part of the prose that answers "should I
 * reach for this tool at all" and drops the part that answers "and how does it
 * combine with others":
 *
 *   KEPT     the `when` section, verbatim — the selection signal
 *   KEPT     every hard refusal / safety clause, wherever it appears — the
 *            sentences whose loss could cause a DESTRUCTIVE or forbidden call
 *   DROPPED  the rest of `notWhen` and `chaining` prose
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS A LOSSY PROJECTION AND SAYS SO. `compactInputSchema` can honestly
 * claim to preserve the callable contract, because everything it removes is
 * advisory to a JSON validator. Prose has no such separation — dropping
 * `chaining` genuinely removes information a model might have used. So this
 * module does not assert "no information lost"; it MEASURES what it removed
 * (`partialGuidanceLoss`) so the trade can be argued from numbers. A projection
 * that claimed losslessness here would be lying.
 *
 * WHY A SAFETY CARVE-OUT. The fields being dropped are exactly where "NEVER
 * call this on a live tree", "refuses unless confirm:true" and similar hard
 * rails live. Dropping prose to save bytes is a cost/benefit call; dropping a
 * rail that prevents a destructive call is not the same kind of call at all, so
 * those sentences are retained regardless of which section they sit in.
 *
 * Domain-free by construction, and therefore here rather than in the host:
 * nothing below knows what a Papercusp tool, workspace or role is.
