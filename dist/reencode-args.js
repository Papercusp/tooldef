/**
 * reencode-args — the EXECUTE half of D-104 (coordination-spec-adoption-2026-08-03, P-016).
 *
 * `corrected-call.ts` is the REFUSAL half: it hands back a finished call and stops. This is
 * its narrower sibling — the corrections that may actually RUN. D-104, quoting the owner:
 *
 *   "if we know the corrected call why not actually run the corrected call and just return
 *    the result (we can also tell them how the system corrected it so they just call it
 *    right the next time)"
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY, and it is the whole of the design. Only a RE-ENCODING may auto-run: a total,
 * deterministic re-shape with exactly ONE candidate output, adding no information the caller
 * did not supply. A DISAMBIGUATION (we chose among candidates) or a MISSING VALUE (the caller
 * omitted something) must refuse, because "running a guess answers a question the caller did
 * not ask". Every correction reachable from `corrected-call.ts` is a disambiguation — a
 * near-name key rename, or a dropped key — which is exactly why that module never executes
 * and this one is a separate, opt-in surface rather than a flag on it.
 *
 * THE DISCLOSURE IS A SAFETY PROPERTY, NOT A NICETY. EI-10883 established that an undeclared
 * arg must be REJECTED rather than silently ignored, because `ok:true` while quietly doing
 * something else is indistinguishable from success. Auto-correction is compatible with that
 * rule ONLY because the correction is announced: structured (`corrected:[{path,sent,ran,rule}]`),
 * prominent in the result, and — see below — measurable afterwards. A rule that ran silently
 * would be the EI-10883 defect wearing a helpful face.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY `reencode` MUST BE PURE, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A STYLE PREFERENCE.
 *
 * D-104's endgame clause makes auto-correction a MIGRATION mechanism, not a permanent shim:
 * log the corrections, watch the per-verb rate, and if it does not decay, promote the shape
 * agents actually send to the DECLARED shape. That measurement needs a before/after series.
 *
 * The instrument already exists and is already populated: `tool_invocations.args_json` records
 * the arguments AS THE CALLER SENT THEM, captured by the dispatcher OUTSIDE this path. So the
 * "after" series is countable with the very same query that produced the "before" baseline
 * (D-107 classified `args_json->body[]->premises` to get its 99.8%-one-shape figure), across
 * the change boundary, from ONE consistent instrument.
 *
 * That property is worth more than a bespoke correction log, and it is bought entirely by
 * purity: re-encode into a NEW object and the ledger keeps the caller's original shape; mutate
 * the input in place and you destroy the only signal that can tell you whether the crutch is
 * working. A stamped-metadata log would additionally exist only from the day it shipped, so the
 * before/after comparison would cross instruments — the classic way a decay measurement lies.
 *
 * Hence: no new column, no new write on the hot path, nothing to drift. The rule is the code;
 * the log is `args_json`. (Derived-truth ladder, rung 1: DERIVE from the single source.)
