/**
 * base-presence — the HARNESS half of the tool-result delta base-presence contract (D-006,
 * `agent-insights/tool-delta-base-presence-contract.mdx`). `delta-client.ts` (DeltaToolClient)
 * holds the cursor + base ROWS and does the merge; this tracks whether the base SNAPSHOT is
 * still in the MODEL's context, so the harness asks a tool for `not_modified`/`delta` (the
 * no-replay token win) ONLY when it can prove the model still holds the base — and falls back
 * to `full` otherwise.
 *
 * Why a separate object from DeltaToolClient: the server validates the cursor/view/scope but
 * CANNOT see the model's context; only the harness — which owns the turn wrapper + the message
 * array — knows whether the base is still present. The client's cached rows and the model's
 * in-context base diverge precisely on compaction: the client still has its copy (so it would
 * happily serve a `not_modified` from cache), but the MODEL lost the snapshot, so re-confirming
 * "nothing changed" would leave the model with a gap. This tracker is the guard that forces a
 * `full` after compaction, re-establishing the base in both. Mirrors coord's
 * `coord_watermarks` + `snapshot_rebootstrap_pending` (see the contract doc).
 *
 * Storage-free + generic (no I/O, no imports beyond a shared type) — one instance per agent
 * session / conversation; drive it from one tool-call loop (not thread-safe). The integration
 * seam is the OMP/psu turn-wrapper that owns the message array — NOT the operator's
 * `runAgentChat`, which only OBSERVES a child agent process's event stream and owns no message
 * array (see the P-003 scoping note in the plan).

 * One base-presence-guarded delta read — the turn-wrapper integration in a SINGLE call,

 * turn-wrapper invokes per delta-capable tool read so adoption is a one-liner; the returned
 * `mode` tells the wrapper what to put in the model's context — `full` → inject the rows;
 * `delta` → inject only the changes (the token win); `not_modified` → inject NOTHING, the base
 * already stands.
 *
 * Safety: it asks the tool for `not_modified`/`delta` ONLY when `haveBase` (so the model can
 * never lose its base across a compaction — call {@link BasePresenceTracker.onCompaction} from
 * the wrapper's compaction hook), and forces a clean `full` whenever the client can't safely
 * reconstruct (evicted base / checksum mismatch). An out-of-scope wrapper (external Claude Code
 * / Codex) constructs the tracker with `{ enabled: false }` ⇒ every read is `full`, byte-identical
 * to today.
 *
 * Contract: `dispatch(requested)` must set the MCP `_meta.delta` to `requested` VERBATIM — the
 * full wire value (`"not_modified~<cursor>"` | `"auto~<cursor>"`) — or omit `_meta.delta` when
 * `requested === undefined` (a cold/forced full). `itemKey` is the registry-resolved row id for
 * the view. On a `supported:false` view the wrapper should additionally call
 * {@link BasePresenceTracker.onUnsupported} (the {@link DeltaResponse} the client observes does
 * not convey `supported`).
