/**
 * Resource-level authorization seam — RFC `tooldef-auth-rfc-2026-05-31`, Phase 1.
 *
 * The coarse gates already live in the dispatch stack (`dispatch-stack.ts`): the agent
 * `roleAllowlist`, the `capability` gate, `harness`, and `quota`. What the framework
 * lacks is the *fine-grained* layer: "can THIS principal act on THIS resource"
 * (ownership / ReBAC / ABAC). Today such a check has nowhere to go but a tool's handler
 * body.
 *
 * This module is that seam's CONTRACT. It is deliberately POLICY-AGNOSTIC: tooldef is
 * the PEP (enforcement point); the *decision* is supplied by the host — either as an
 * in-process closure or by delegating to an external PDP (OPA / Cedar / OpenFGA /
 * Cerbos / an AuthZEN-compliant engine). tooldef ships the contract + one trivial
 * owner-check helper and **no policy engine** (shipping one would be the
 * lowest-common-denominator trap).
 *
 * SCOPE — this is additive and changes no behavior. The dispatch-stack *enforcement*
 * step (a `DispatchStep` that runs a tool's `authorize` after the existing gates, fails
 * closed, and composes with `GateBypass`) is **Phase 1b**, gated on RFC decision **D-F**
 * (`GateBypass.policy`) and on the tooldef owner's review of where the step sits in the
 * stack. Until then, this module just lets hosts (and Restart) author `PolicyDecisionPoint`
 * implementations + `authorize`-shaped functions against a stable contract.
 *
 * Uses the CURRENT `Principal` (identity = `slug`); the generic `Principal<TKind>` /
 * `roles` / `attributes` evolution is RFC Phase 2 and orthogonal to this contract.

 * is chosen now so it won't need to change then).

 * throws, and audits every decision.
 *
 * It runs *in-process* with the tool's `ctx`, so — unlike an external PDP — it can load
 * the resource it needs to decide (the "authorize close to the data" pattern, RFC §8 G1):
 * extract an id from `input`, fetch via `ctx`, decide. For list endpoints, return a row
 * filter via `AuthDecision.obligations` rather than checking each row.
 *
 * `principal` is the dispatch-layer caller identity (`null`/`undefined` for an anonymous
 * call); a resource hook should treat the absent case as deny. It is the *narrow*
 * principal the dispatcher carries (identity = `slug`), not the rich route-layer
 * `Principal` — a hook that wants to query a full `PolicyDecisionPoint` builds an
 * `AuthzQuery` from what it knows. The host may close over a `PolicyDecisionPoint`
 * (in-proc or external engine) inside the hook — the framework neither ships nor assumes
 * one. `TCtx`/`TPrincipal` are the host's context + principal types (Papercusp binds its
 * `UnifiedToolContext`); kept generic so authz.ts imports no host types.
