/**
 * result-annotator — a host-registered, result-time envelope annotator.
 *
 * The generic complement to {@link applySeeAlso}. Where `seeAlso` renders a tool's OWN
 * declared cross-links, this is a single HOST-level hook that runs on EVERY settled tool
 * result: the host inspects `(result, ctx)` and MAY append an ambient line (e.g.
 * Papercusp's banded context-usage gauge — agent-managed-compaction P-013) without any
 * tool declaring it. The library owns the SEAM (invoke-step call + fail-safety); the host
 * owns the POLICY (what, if anything, to append) — the same "declare the port here, wire
 * the impl host-side" model as `setSemanticDeltaEnabledResolver` /
 * `setCapabilityTierResolver`.
 *
 * Default is the identity (no annotator registered ⇒ zero-cost no-op), so every existing
 * consumer/test is behavior-neutral. The annotator MUST be cheap + synchronous (it runs
 * inline on the dispatch hot path); a host that needs I/O caches it out-of-band and the
 * annotator only reads the cache.
