 * EI-7689: a compact (non-JSON) tool response self-identifies with a leading `format:
 * <fmt>\n` marker (TOON/CSV/TSV/MD — serialize-result.ts) — none of those are valid JSON,
 * so a plain `JSON.parse` always THROWS on them and this used to silently fall back to
 * handing the script the raw marker+encoded STRING as its `result`. Any in-script
 * truthiness/property check on that string (`if (result.ok)`) then silently lies: a
 * non-empty string is always truthy no matter what's encoded inside it, so a genuine
 * server-side failure can read as success. Reproduced live 2026-07-05 (su-15a64): a
 * `plans:new` call failed server-side (`similar_exists`) but returned a truthy TOON
 * string, and the script's `result.ok` check passed, reporting a phantom plan creation.
 * Parse the marker first and DECODE with the matching format (the lossless inverse of
 * the encoder that produced it) so the script always sees the real structured value.
 *
 * WI-6458 is the same failure from the other direction: a PROXIED upstream MCP server
 * (gitnexus) ends its text with a chat affordance — `\n\n---\n**Next:** READ gitnexus://…`
 * — after otherwise-valid JSON, so `JSON.parse` throws and the script got the raw string.
 * `parseJsonWithTrailer` recovers the leading value; the trailing prose is DROPPED for the
 * script (it addresses a human/model reading the raw text, and the direct MCP path still
 * returns it verbatim — only the code-mode facade unwraps).

 * content) — independent of whatever shape the handler's own JSON body happens to
 * use. Several handlers signal failure via a bare `{ error: '<code>', ... }` body
 * with NO `ok: false` field (plans:new's `similar_exists` refusal is the reported
 * case: `{ error: 'similar_exists', slug, similar, hint }`, isError: true) — every
 * sibling refusal in the same file has the identical shape (`busy`, `slug_exists`).
 * Downstream, `isOkFalseResult` (orchestrate.ts) and a script's own idiomatic
 * `res?.ok !== false` guard both only recognize a top-level `ok === false`, so the
 * bare-`error` shape reads as a SUCCESS — no plan is written, but the caller (and
 * the orchestrator's own semantic-failure tally) never finds out. Stamping
 * `ok: false` onto the unwrapped value whenever the protocol says `isError` closes
 * the gap for every existing and future handler using this shape, without
 * requiring each one to remember to add `ok: false` explicitly. A handler that
 * already sets `ok: false` (or anything other than a plain object, e.g. a raw-text

 * wolf on the most common failure (a bad arg) is worse than no warning.
