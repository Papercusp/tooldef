/**
 * server-vintage — a host-registered "how stale is this process" resolver.
 *
 * EI-19953470656367880: a long-lived server process (a Tauri desktop's own spawned
 * operator, chief among them — it has no file-watch and runs whatever code it booted
 * with, indefinitely) rejects a newly-added tool arg with a bare `Unrecognized key`
 * error. Nothing in that error says WHY: the caller (often a hot-reloaded UI sending
 * an arg the process's own code predates) has no way to distinguish "I made a typo"
 * from "the server I'm talking to is hours old and has never seen this arg exist."
 * Both look identical from the wire.
 *
 * The library owns the SEAM (where to hang the extra line, and how to fail safe);
 * the HOST owns the POLICY (what its own build id + boot time actually are) — the
 * same "declare the port here, wire the impl host-side" split as `result-annotator.ts`
 * / `setSemanticDeltaEnabledResolver`. This file stays host-agnostic on purpose: a
 * generic `libs/generic/*` package must not know what "PAPERCUSP_BUILD_SHA" is.
 *
 * Default is unregistered (no resolver ⇒ the unknown-arg hint is unchanged), so every
 * existing consumer/test is behavior-neutral until a host opts in.

/**
 * The mirror of `serverVintageHint` for a CONSTRAINT violation (`minItems`, an enum
 * member, a range, a regex) — appended to a value-level invalid_args error.
 *
 * EI-21353729155349111: `serverVintageHint` covers the caller being NEWER than the
 * server (an arg the process predates). The mirror case is the server enforcing a
 * constraint the tree has since RELAXED, and it is strictly nastier to diagnose,
 * because the evidence a reader naturally reaches for actively misleads them: they
 * open the tool's source in the tree, see no such constraint, and conclude the error
 * is a defect in the tool rather than a skew between two versions of it. That is not
 * hypothetical — it cost a full investigation in EI-21310032409432146, where
 * `work_items:complete` refused `verification.coverage.residue: []` against a live
 * `minItems: 1` the tree had already dropped. An `Unrecognized key` would have been
 * annotated; the `too_small` that actually fired was not.
 *
 * WHY THIS GATES ON NOTHING BUT REGISTRATION (the design question EI-21353729155349111
 * left open, both of whose proposed gates are wrong):
 *
 *   - Gating on `bootedAgoMs` inverts the signal. The host wires it to
 *     `process.uptime()`, so it measures how long THIS PROCESS has run, not how old
 *     its CODE is. A process restarted two minutes ago from a three-day-old build is
 *     the most dangerous case there is, and an age threshold scores it "fresh" —
 *     suppressing the hint exactly when it was needed.
 *   - Gating on a real per-tool staleness probe (comparing the tool's defining file
 *     between the serving build and the tree) is precise, but every such probe is
 *     async and this is synchronous error construction. Wiring it needs an
 *     out-of-band cache — new machinery on a failure path, to suppress one sentence.
 *
 * So this follows the same discipline `serverVintageHint` already established: state
 * the vintage, phrase the consequence CONDITIONALLY, and let the reader judge. A
 * caller who really did send a bad enum reads past one clause; a caller staring at a
 * constraint that does not exist in the source in front of them is handed the answer.
 *
 * Deliberately ONE sentence: it lands on the value-level branch that EI-10943 keeps
 * free of the full args-schema dump precisely because that dump is context burn for a
 * caller who already knows the shape. This must not re-litigate that.
