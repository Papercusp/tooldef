/**
 * rows-delta — server-side delta negotiation for a BARE ROW ARRAY (a sync RESOURCE),
 * the resolver/SSE-path sibling of define-tool's `negotiateToolDelta`. Where the tool
 * path negotiates over a ToolResponse, a sync resolver (e.g. `plans.attention`) returns
 * a plain rows array; this composes the SAME delta primitives (computeRowDigest +
 * computeViewChecksum + diffFromDigest + the cursor codec) to turn "client cursor + the
 * freshly-resolved rows" into a `full` or `delta` response.
 *
 * agent-tool-delta-client-rollout-2026-06-23 P-006 (the 327GB sync win): the UI re-fetches
 * the full ~633KB plans.attention view on every plans-table invalidation. With a delta-aware
 * client (useSyncResource sending its cursor) only the changed rows travel. Correctness is the
 * SAME structural guarantee as the tool path: the response carries the full-view `checksum`, the
 * client verifies its merge against it and refetches a full on any mismatch — never a wrong view.

    // than as a silent `full`.
    //
    // `DELTA_MAX_DIGEST_ENTRIES` is a ROW count, but what actually breaks is CURSOR BYTES: the
    // cursor is echoed back as a `?delta=` QUERY PARAM, so a digest that "fits" by row count can
    // still blow the request line. Measured live on :3170 against `workItems.byHarness`
    // (~49 cursor bytes/row):
    //
    //     100 rows →  4,312 char cursor → 200 OK
    //     300 rows → 14,591 char cursor → 200 OK

    // which is strictly worse than the full re-send it was meant to replace.

    // Parking is already the proven path for every large view (plans.list/byHive/codeRecipes) and
