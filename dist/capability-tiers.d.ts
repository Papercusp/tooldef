/**
 * Capability → tier classification (plan P-010 / P-012, D-006).
 *
 * Tiers are host policy, not engine knowledge: a capability string like
 * `secrets:read:*` is "high" only because a particular host says so. The
 * engine therefore ships no table — it exposes a pluggable resolver that
 * `defineTool`/`defineResource`/`definePrompt` consult at registration to
 * stamp each definition's `tier`. The default classifies everything as
 * `'low'`; a host registers its real policy via `setCapabilityTierResolver`
 * before its tools self-register (Papercusp does this in
 * `@papercusp/agent-mcp`'s `capability-tiers-papercusp.ts`).
 *
 * `tier` is descriptive metadata (surfaced in catalogs / prompt assembly);
 * the dispatcher does not gate on it.
